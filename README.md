# ![Logo](./public/logo.svg) News Website Project

This is a personal project for a news web application, where data from the New York Times API is consumed. The application is built with React and uses useContext for global state management. Additionally, it includes a system to unlock access to the news section through a form submission.n

## API Reference

#### Get all items

```http
  GET https://api.nytimes.com/svc/news/v3/content/all/all.json?api-key={API_KEY}
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `api_key` | `string` | **Required**. Your API key |


## Features

- Consumption of the New York Times API: The most recent news articles are retrieved.
- Global State Management with useContext: useContext is used to centralize the app's state and share the API data across different components.
- Unlock News Section: The news section is initially locked and is unlocked once a form is completed. This is also managed through global state.
- Responsive for smartphone and desktop

## Functionality
- API Consumption: When the application starts, a request is made to the New York Times API to fetch the news.
- Unlock Form: Before displaying the news, the user needs to complete a form. Once submitted, access to the news section is unlocked using the global state managed by `subcribeContext`.
